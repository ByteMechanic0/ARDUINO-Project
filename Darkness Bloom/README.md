🌑 Darkness Bloom

Darkness Bloom is an ambient light experiment where darkness is not a trigger — it’s a moment.

Instead of instantly turning a light on or off, this project creates a slow, intentional emergence of light when the environment becomes dark, and a graceful fade to complete black when light returns.

No flicker.
No harsh transitions.
Just a calm, almost artistic behavior.

✨ What makes it different

Fully off when light is present

Smooth, organic fade-in when darkness appears.
Hysteresis-based logic to avoid unstable switching.
Sensor smoothing for clean, natural transitions.
The LED doesn’t “switch on”.
It blooms.

🧠 Idea

Most Arduino light projects react immediately.
Darkness Bloom reacts deliberately.
The goal is not visibility, but atmosphere.

🧩 Hardware

Arduino (Uno / Nano / compatible)
LDR (photoresistor)
10kΩ resistor
LED
220Ω–330Ω resistor
Breadboard and jumper wires

⚙️ Behavior

Bright environment → LED fades out completely
Entering darkness → LED slowly emerges
Stable light conditions → stable, calm output

Designed to feel intentional, not mechanical.

🌌 Possible evolutions

RGB ambient version
Color temperature shifts (warm night / cold day)
Non-linear brightness curves
Interactive or decorative installations
Stable light conditions → stable, calm output
